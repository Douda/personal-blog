## Why this blog exists

I start with reading and watching to understand the concepts. But I learn for real by implementing, breaking, and fixing. This blog documents that process in public—sharing real projects as I study, not just notes after the fact. My goal: demonstrate I can build cloud solutions, not just pass exams.

For 2026, I'm sharing actual implementations while I learn. Real infrastructure. Real problems solved. Real mistakes documented.

## Current Status

Following the [Cloud Mastery Bootcamp](https://digitalcloud.training/cloud-mastery-bootcamp/) DevOps Engineer pathway.

**Earned:**
- Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

**In Progress:**
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate

## What's Coming

Hands-on projects. Architecture decisions. Honest post-mortems.

Theory gets you started. Building (especially breaking and fixing) makes it stick.
