## Why this blog exists

### Quick intro

I wanted to learn more about the cloud in general. 2026 will be the year for me on this topic. The past few months I started a couple of certs to understand the basics of k8s & AWS 

- Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

Gives me enough theory to get started, now slowly ramping up with the next cert 

- AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)

### Goals

The biggest issues I see is that many people take basically the same path, but stop at certifications. I want to go the extra mile > sharing actual implementations & real world projects while I learn. If I don't do it, I'll forget it all in a year and wont be able to show any of those skills.


If you're interested, I started the [Cloud Mastery Bootcamp](https://digitalcloud.training/cloud-mastery-bootcamp/) DevOps Engineer pathway to get to know more about the cloud


### What's Coming

Let's play around with some projects to apply what I learn on the SAA cert ! 
Hands-on projects. I'm already having fun with the AWS console & CloudShell for the theory, let's practice on real world stuff now
